## Linear Regression

#### Assumptions for Linear Reqression
- The mean of the response at each value of the predictor is a linear function of the preditor
- the errors are independent
- the error at each value of the predictor are Normally distributed
- the error at each value of the predictor have the equal variance

#### Why we need to make those assumptions
1.  The mean of the response at each value of the predictor is a linear function of the preditor
2. Why errors should be normally distributed?
- The methods used for parameter estimation (MLE) can also imply the assumption of normally distributed random errors. 
  This assumption is requered to make sure that the ordinary least squares estimators are unbiased.
