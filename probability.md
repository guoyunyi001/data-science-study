## Probability Theory

- Probability
- Bayes'Theorem


## Distribution
#### Discrete Distribution
#### Continuous Distribution
- Binomial Distribution
- Pisson Distribution
- Normal Distribution
#### Birvariate Distribution
- Birvariate normal distirbution
#### Distribution of function of random variables
- Central Limit Theorem: random sample from a distribution, if the sample size is 'sufficiently large' then the sample mean follows an approximate normal distribution. 
- The use CLT: we can use normal distribution to discribe or estimate the  sample mean of a data sample
 - Normal Approximation to Binomial
 - Normal Approximation to Poisson
 

## Estimation
#### Point Estimation &Confidence Interval
- Maximum likelihood estimation
a method of estimating the parametor which maximizes the probability or the likelihood of getting the data we observed.
- Unbaised estimator 
- Confidence interval
 for a random smaple from a normal distibution, the (1-&alpha)% confidence interval for the mean

$$(x-z_{\alpha/2}(\sigma/\sqrt{n}), x+z_{\alpha/2}(\sigma/\sqrt{n}))$$
