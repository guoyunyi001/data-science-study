#### Discrete Random Variable
#### Continuous Random Variable
###### Binomial Distribution
  A discrete random variable X is a binomial random variable if:
- An experiment, or trial, is performed in exactly the same way n times.
Each of the n trials has only two possible outcomes.  One of the outcomes is called a "success," while the other is called a "failure." Such a trial is called a  Bernoulli trial.
- The n trials are independent.
- The probability of success, denoted p, is the same for each trial. The probability of failure is q = 1 âˆ’ p.
- The random variable X = the number of successes in the n trials.
######Poisson Distribution
 the discrete random variable X denote the number of times an event occurs in an interval of time (or space). Then X may be a Poisson random variable with x = 0, 1, 2, ...

######Normal Distribution
